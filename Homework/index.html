We're no strangers to loooooooove
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You'll never get this from any other guy
Iiiiiiiii just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Got to make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around
And desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie
